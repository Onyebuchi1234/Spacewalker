           As we go further and further away,it[the Earth] diminished in size.Finally it shrank to the size of a<br>marble,the most beautiful you can imagine. That beautiful, warm,living object looked so fragile, so<br>delicate,that if you touched it with a finger it would fall apart. Seeing this has to change a man.

           The Earth was small, light blue, and so<br>
           touchingly alone, our home that must be<br>

           and blue, was the Earth. I put my thumb and<br>
           shut one eye, and my thumb blotted out the<br>
           planet Earth.
